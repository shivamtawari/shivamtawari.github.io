## Hello there, I'm Shivam Tawari! 👋

I'm a Research Associate at the Indian School of Business (ISB) 🏫, focusing on the intersection of information systems and strategy. I'm particularly interested in exploring how advanced data analytics, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️ and Large Language Models (LLMs) 🤖, can be applied to strategic decision-making and organizational processes.

My current work at ISB involves analyzing large-scale datasets 📊 from sources like Factiva and Compustat. I utilize tools like Stata for statistical analysis and Python 🐍 for machine learning tasks. My experience with the Hugging Face 🤗 ecosystem, particularly the Transformers library, allows me to build and fine-tune LLMs for tasks such as text classification, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. I'm keen to investigate how these technologies can provide deeper insights into complex business phenomena.

Prior to ISB, I worked as a Data Analyst at Capgemini 💻, developing and deploying deep learning models for computer vision. This experience, combined with my research in multimodal machine learning and time-series analysis, has given me a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied AI.

My aim is to contribute significantly to the body of knowledge at the intersection of data science, AI, and business 🚀. I'm excited to conduct rigorous research that bridges the gap between cutting-edge technology and real-world business applications.
