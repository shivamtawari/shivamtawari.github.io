## The Challenge

Breaking down communication barriers is a significant global challenge. We wanted to create an accessible, real-time tool that could facilitate seamless conversation between speakers of different languages, including regional Indian languages. This project was our submission for the Smart India Hackathon 2022.

## The Solution: A Multi-Modal Translation App

Interpreter.ai is a web application that provides real-time, multi-modal translation. The core of the application is a deep learning model trained on the extensive FLORES-200 multilingual dataset, which allowed us to achieve a **91.4% validation accuracy** across 204 languages.

## Outcome

- **Winner, Smart India Hackathon 2022**
